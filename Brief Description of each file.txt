Requires
OpenCV

Example 1.py 
Has two windows

The first:
if you click your left mouse button it will return the XY points of where you click on the image. 
else if you right click the image it will return the RGB value of the current pixel
The second:
Two windows will come up, one with your slide bars for manipulating your image in real time
The second is four images stacked next to one another showing you each technique 
taking place each time you move the slide bars


I have hundreds of more of these files doing tons of different things, but here is just a few files I through together. 

Thanks,
